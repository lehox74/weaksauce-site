        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I’ve spent the last 30 years building things — businesses, products, habits, identities. I’m a serial entrepreneur. Some of my ventures took off. Some fell flat. One startup even went bankrupt after 5+ years of effort. All of it taught me something.</p>
        
        <p>I’ve run companies from beach cafés in Hawaii. I’ve launched products I’m proud of, made bets that didn’t pay off, and learned the hard way what happens when you avoid the truth for too long.</p>
        
        <p>The idea for <strong>WeakSauce</strong> didn’t come during a win. It showed up when everything felt like it was falling apart. No more hype. No more pretending. Just this quiet voice in my head that said,<br>
        <em>“That wasn’t it. Let’s do better.”</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>That voice showed me a path to better.</strong></p>
        
        <p>I started showing up differently — not because I had it all figured out, but because I was finally ready to stop lying to myself. I cleaned up my routines. Faced some uncomfortable truths. Rebuilt from the inside out. Slowly. Honestly. With reps.</p>
        
        <p><strong>WeakSauce</strong> became the name for that process. The mindset I use to stay in the game. A label for the moments I almost slip — and the standard I return to when I want to level up.</p>
        
        <p>Back in 2014, I gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QnhMMxa4m8" target="_blank">TEDx talk</a> about chasing big ideas and trusting your instincts. That version of me was still in the climb — full of curiosity, still learning what real resilience looks like. A lot’s changed since then, but the core hasn’t: I still believe your best work comes when you stop waiting and start building.</p>
        
        <p>I’m not a coach. I’m not a guru. I’m just someone who believes that self-awareness is the real flex — and that the people who get stronger are the ones willing to call themselves out.</p>
        
        <p>If that resonates with you, stick around. You’re in the right place.</p>
